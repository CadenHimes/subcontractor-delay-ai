# Subcontractor-Delay-AI

**Goal.** Investigate the impact of subcontractor availability on heavy construction delay and build an **AI-based early warning system** for subcontractor performance deterioration on FDOT roadway projects.

## Research Focus
- **Topic A:** *AI-Based Early Detection of Subcontractor Performance Deterioration: Preventing Cascade Failures in Infrastructure Projects*  
  - **RQ:** Can AI detect early warning signs of subcontractor performance deterioration in **daily construction reports**, and what is the **cascade impact** when detection fails?  
  - **Motivation:** “Early detection could have prevented **$395,006** in damages—here’s the AI that can do it.”
